## Image Manifest

-   **01.png:** A refresher exercise verifying command line proficiency. Shows the creation of the `USSmovies` directory and files (`top_gun_maverick`, etc.), followed by their deletion to practice file management.
-   **02.png:** Preparing the environment by creating the three required input files (`animal1`, `animal2`, `animal3`) and populating them with content ("leopard", "dog", "cat") using VS Code and the terminal.
-   **03.png:** The complete execution flow: verifying file content, changing permissions (`chmod +x`), debugging the "Something is missing" error by creating the `uss2output` directory, and finally executing the script successfully to view the congratulatory message.
